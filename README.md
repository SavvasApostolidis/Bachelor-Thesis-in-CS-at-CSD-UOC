Head Re-enactment for Sign Language synthesis

A project report by Savvas Apostolidis for the academic year 2020-2021.


Abstractâ€” In this project, we evaluate the potential of head re-enactment methods to be
used for Sign Language synthesis, more specifically the method of Head2Head++[DC21].
Our goal is to create and test scenarios involving Sign Language videos to discover what
artifacts appear in the process of the re-enactment, what are the limitations of the current
method proposed and which possible improvements can be suggested to further support
Sign Language synthesis using head re-enactment methods similar to Head2Head++.
